## BomberMate 

Project created to enhance my knowledge on C++ and design patters. This project use the library Allegro5 to handle basically the image rendering and keyboard events. All the component mechanics and the views (menu, stage, game over) have been developed, so I could experience several aspects of C++ and applied many design patters (State pattern, factory, visitor, observer).

The project was originally built in Ubuntu, but you may run it with windows as long as the Allegro5 library is correctly installed.
